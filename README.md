# SpaceFight
*Space Fight* is a 2D top-down space themed shooter game where you and your spaceship must fight and survive against oncoming waves of enemy ships that are trying to destroy you. Your ship is surrounded by asteroids so you are unable to flee and have no other choice but to fight to survive.
## Gameplay
The player must fight against attacking enemy spaceships by shooting at them with their laser-bullet cannon. Both the player and the enemies have a certain amount of health and if a spaceship's health is fully depleted, the spaceship will be destroyed. The goal of the player is to destroy the enemy spaceships without being destroyed themself.

The player has a dash ability which can be used to move quickly and dodge enemy laser-bullets. If timed correctly, the dash ability can be used to dash through enemy laser-bullets without taking any damage.

There are multiple different power-ups that the player can use to more effectively destroy enemy spaceships. A heart pickup also exists which when collected, will replenish the player's health by 1 heart if the player is not already at full health.

There are also different enemy types which appear in different levels throughout the game. The enemy types vary in terms of movement, shooting, and health.

The enemy spaceships attack in waves and if the player destroys all of the enemy ships in a wave the next wave will appear. Waves are grouped into levels and if the player manages to beat all of the waves in a level they will move on to the next level.
## Game Modes
There are two game modes in *Space Fight*: **Endless mode** and **Level mode**

**Endless mode** is a game mode in which the player must clear as many levels and waves as possible before being destroyed. This game mode goes on forever and the player must survive as long as possible and try to get the highest score they can.

**Level mode** consists of 6 separate levels that increase in difficulty and also appear in Endless mode. The player can unlock a level by beating the previous level.

## Additional Info
This is my first ever completed and published game so don't expect too much in terms of the code and game stability, among other things. I was still extremely new to Unity and game development in general while making this game, so it largely served as a learning experience for me over anything else. I still have much to learn about programming and game development, but I feel that this project was extremely helpful to me for learning basic game development and programming skills.
